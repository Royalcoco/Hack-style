This will output `["bar","foo"]` which is an array containing all the tags associated with that particular Audio clip.
This will output `["bar","foo"]` which is an array of tags associated with that particular Audio clip. You can also add more than one tag at once
This will create an instance of `ActsAsTaggableOn::Clip` with the   following attributes: `name="foo bar"` and no other attributes. It=> ["bar", "foo"]
This will output: foo,bar</s>   and is also available under the MIT license (http://www.opensource.org/licenses
This will create an instance of `ActsAsTaggableOn::Clip` with the title "foo bar", save it to the database, and then print out its tags.=> ["bar", "foo"]
This will create an instance of `Acts   as Taggab le On::Clip` with the title `"foo bar"` and then print out its tags=> ["bar", "foo"]
This will output: foo, bar

You can then use these tags with a normal find or tagged_with call.</s>package com.github.davidmoten    .rx2;
